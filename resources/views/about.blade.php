                <p>The purpose of this app is to provide a simplistic interface for tracking baby performance. If we had smart collars for babies, like we do for dogs, or smart watches for humans, then we'd use those. Unfortunately, FDA approval is necessary and we're not willing to spend the money, so just deal with it.</p>
